"""Probe a push-to-talk key/chord to verify pynput sees it on THIS machine.

Useful before committing to a VOICEPI_KEY value - if this probe doesn't
see the key, whisper-dictate won't either, and you'll just see a silent
non-trigger. Common gotchas this catches:

  * Pause/Break key missing on tenkeyless / laptop keyboards
  * Pause/Break intercepted by gaming-keyboard firmware (Razer/Corsair)
  * Caps_lock state-toggle behaviour (press fires, release doesn't -
    breaks hold-to-talk)
  * Multimedia keys eaten by OEM software before reaching pynput
  * Chords like ctrl_r+space being filtered by IMEs / IntelliSense

Usage:
  python scripts/probe-key.py                    # passive: log EVERY key event
  python scripts/probe-key.py pause              # active: confirm Pause arrives
  python scripts/probe-key.py ctrl_r+space       # active: confirm a chord
  python scripts/probe-key.py shift_r+ctrl_r 30  # custom duration (seconds)

Exit codes:
  0 - chord verified (or passive mode finished)
  1 - no events captured at all (OS not delivering)
  2 - events captured but full chord was never held together
  3 - invalid key name passed
