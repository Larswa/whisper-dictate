# Changelog

All notable changes to whisper-dictate are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Entries below v0.2.36 were generated retroactively from `git log` per
tag; chore-bump lines (winget manifests, nix/package.nix) trail each
release because `release.yml` bumps in-place after the tag is pushed.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.57] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Config-driven target profiles matched by active window title/process.
- Profiles can override live-safe settings such as `inject_mode`, `lang`, `initial_prompt`, dictionary settings and audio thresholds for matched targets.
- Active profile is logged and included in metrics/history events.

## [0.2.56] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Local dictation history JSONL storage for accepted live utterances.
- `VOICEPI_HISTORY_ENABLED` and `VOICEPI_HISTORY_JSONL` settings for local history control/location.
- History CLI helpers: `--history-list`, `--history-last`, `--history-copy-last`, and `--history-reinject-last`.

## [0.2.55] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- `--calibrate-mic [SECONDS]` records a short microphone sample and recommends audio threshold settings.
- `--calibrate-file PATH` analyzes an existing audio file for repeatable calibration/testing.
- Calibration JSON output via `--json`, including raw dBFS, noise floor, SNR, peak and recommended `VOICEPI_TARGET_DBFS`, `VOICEPI_MIN_INPUT_DBFS`, and `VOICEPI_MIN_SNR_DB`.

## [0.2.54] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- `--benchmark-files` command to run one or more audio files through selected backend/model specs.
- `--benchmark-backends` accepts comma-separated specs such as `whisper:large-v3,parakeet:nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`.
- `--benchmark-jsonl` writes one structured result per file/backend, including success/failure metadata.

## [0.2.53] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- `--transcribe-file PATH` command for reproducible file transcription using the selected backend/config.
- Native 16-bit WAV decoding with mono conversion and resampling to 16 kHz.
- ffmpeg fallback for mp3/m4a/other formats when ffmpeg is installed.
- File transcription JSON output using `--json`, including backend/model, timing, language, source file and dictionary replacement metadata.

## [0.2.52] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Windows Settings UI now has visible `?` help on Core, Quality, Dictionary and Output settings. The help opens on click and is shown explicitly on hover so it does not depend on platform tooltip timing.
- `VOICEPI_RELEASE_TAIL_MS` live setting adds a short audio tail after hotkey release to avoid clipping final syllables/words.
- Parakeet startup/transcription noise from NeMo is hidden by default and exposed only with `VOICEPI_STT_DEBUG=1`.

### Changed
- Parakeet model choices are trimmed to the practical options: multilingual `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`, pure-English quality `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b`, and fast English-only `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`.
- Settings UI disables Whisper-only controls, including compute type, when Parakeet is selected.
- Documentation now clarifies that Parakeet v3 autodetects language and does not support forcing `VOICEPI_LANG=da`.

### Fixed
- Windows injection now uses paste automatically for layout-sensitive punctuation such as English contractions on Danish keyboard layouts.
- Parakeet/NeMo progress and training-related logs no longer clutter the normal UI runtime log.

## [0.2.41] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- `VOICEPI_INJECT_MODE=auto` is now the default injection strategy. It types directly except for known fragile Windows terminal targets, where it uses clipboard paste.
- `--type` CLI flag to force direct keyboard typing when `auto` or env configuration would choose another strategy.
- `scripts/inject-smoke.py` for manual injection checks against Notepad, Windows Terminal, Claude Code, browser fields, and other targets without loading Whisper.
- Startup now prints the running `whisper-dictate` version in the launcher/terminal window. Release zips and Windows installers get the version from the tag; development checkouts fall back to `git describe`.

### Changed
- `pynput` is lazy-loaded again so `python voice_pi.py --help` stays independent of OS keyboard backends.
- Replaced the pynput listener polling loop with `Listener.join()` and changed the `arecord` probe from raw sleep to process timeout handling.
- `windows-installer.yml` now treats `vp_*.py` changes as Windows-relevant, so installer builds are not skipped when split modules change.
- Windows/Linux launchers no longer force `--paste`; they let the app's `auto` injection strategy decide unless the user passes an explicit mode.

## [0.2.40] - 2026-05-23

### Removed
- Removed the `VOICEPI_TYPE_INTERVAL_MS` per-character typing delay and restored direct `pynput.Controller.type(text)` injection.

### Changed
- Removed fixed sleeps around text injection and replaced ydotoold startup waits with short readiness polling.
- Added a permissive repo-local Codex configuration for trusted local development.

## [0.2.38] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed
- **Injection regression on Windows**: revert `from pynput import keyboard` from lazy (inside `Dictate.__init__`) back to module top-level in `voice_pi.py` and `vp_inject.py`. The lazy import (introduced in v0.2.36's refactor) appears to have introduced a subtle timing issue where pynput's `Controller.type(text)` dropped some spaces between words on the target terminal — reported as concatenations like "harjegbundetden" / "stillsomethingfishy" in injected text even though `[stt]` showed the correct Whisper output. `sounddevice` stays lazy so the smoke-test job remains lightweight.

## [0.2.37] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- `VOICEPI_TEMPERATURE` env-var: comma-separated list of Whisper decode temperatures (default `0.0,0.2`). Set to `0.0` to lock to greedy decode and eliminate the fallback that produces "creative" output on uncertain segments.
- `VOICEPI_CONTEXT_MIN_SECONDS` env-var: pass `condition_on_previous_text=True` only when the utterance is at least this long (default `0` = always off). Useful for long sentences where context helps Whisper keep word boundaries coherent.
- 6 new unit tests covering `_parse_temperatures` parsing and the duration-gated context decision.

## [0.2.36] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep-a-Changelog) covering every release from v0.1.0 onward.
- `vp_cli.py` (argparse + `VOICEPI_DEBUG` settings dump) and `vp_transcribe.py` (Whisper call + hallucination filter) — extracted from `voice_pi.py` so each module has a single responsibility. `voice_pi.py` re-exports every name so installer/tests/downstream callers are unaffected.
- Cross-platform `smoke` CI job (ubuntu-latest + windows-latest) running `voice_pi.py --help` and `scripts/probe-key.py bogus_key 1`.
- `lint-workflows` CI job: `yaml.safe_load` of every workflow + `rhysd/actionlint`.
- 15 new unit tests: `ModuleSurfaceTests`, `HallucinationFilterTests`, `CliModuleIsolationTests` (48 → 63 total).

### Changed
- `voice_pi.py` shrunk from 577 to 401 lines after the split.
- `sounddevice`, `pynput`, and `faster_whisper` are now lazy-imported inside `Dictate` methods and `__main__`. `python voice_pi.py --help` runs with only `numpy` installed.
- Soft-pinned `sounddevice>=0.4,<0.6`, `pynput>=1.7,<2.0`, `pyperclip>=1.8,<2.0`, `evdev>=1.6,<2.0` in both `requirements-cpu.txt` and `requirements-gpu.txt`.
- `release.yml` builds the release asset list as a bash array (shellcheck SC2086).

### Fixed
- `DeviceResolutionTests` now isolates `VOICEPI_COMPUTE_TYPE` so the suite passes on machines where the user has the env var set.
- `AudioDspTests` skips cleanly when numpy is not installed (previously crashed `setUpClass`).
